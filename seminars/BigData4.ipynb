map filter or reduce on an RDD by passing a function to Spark which then schedules the function s execution in parallel on the cluster 2 These operations and additional ones such as joins take RDDs as input and produce new RDDs RDDs are immutable and their operations are lazy fault tolerance is achieved by keeping track of the lineage of each RDD the sequence of operations that produced it so that
